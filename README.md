## âœ… Solved Problems

1.You must be facing plotting issue i.e Inconsistent values on X or Y axis possibly due to input size or measurement errors
One approach is averaging for each sample size however this will result in slow execution of overall program but one can 
get somewhere smooth graph 

My approach is simple.If we just increase the sample size and have larger offset from each sample we will get smooth graph 
without using averaging tecnhinque 

-This way no extra time is consumed !
