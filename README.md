## âœ… Solved Problems

1.You must be facing plotting issue i.e Inconsistent values on X or Y axis possibly due to input size or measurement errors
One approach is averaging for each sample size however this will result in slow execution of overall program but one can 
get somewhere smooth graph 

We need to calculate the scaling factor while plotting theoretical graph 

This way no extra time is consumed !
